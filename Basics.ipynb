    "# Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com/) is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango's officials said that this was due to a bug in their system, and that they would fix the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to analyze recent movie ratings data to determine if they fixed the bug since Walt Hickey's analysis."

A later analysis might involve re-sampling the data, though that may be impossible since Fandango \"fixed\" the availability of some of the data originally sampled in 2015 by Hickey. For now, we'll change the goal of our analysis based on the data available."
